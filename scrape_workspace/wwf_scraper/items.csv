"<p>MONHEGAN PLANTATION — It's a cliché fantasy we've all heard, maybe even indulged in ourselves—move to an island year-round, soak up the rhythm of the seasons, the quiet, the isolation, and write the great American novel.</p> <p>Judy Weber—who writes under the name Judith Ponturo, her maiden name—moved to Monhegan year-round in 2006 after visiting the island regularly since 1990.</p> <p>A retired fourth-grade reading teacher, she's recently published her first collection of poetry, <em>Cutting the Grass with Scissors—Monhegan Poems</em>. But there's nothing cliché about the work.</p> <p>True, it's clear island life has seeped into Weber's mind and soul, as the 60-plus poems reflect. But each word meditation, each wry, wistful, sad, playful or philosophical observation is not about place. Instead, the poems, most in the five- to seven-stanza range, take the reader inside. The settings, however unique to that offshore life, are secondary to their truth. And the truths, small or deep, are accessible and moving.</p> <p>""Monhegan was not the only thing that moves me,"" Weber said, reflecting on the source of the poems, ""but this whole way of life was something that moved me.""</p> <p>So lugging ""stuff"" from the pier, dealing with living in an electricity ""dead zone,"" walking home from movie night in February, sweeping the never-quite-clean ""fish house floor"" and dozens of other island-specific references were fertile ground for conceiving poems.</p> <p>But Weber aimed with each at a more universal truth, she explained.</p> <p>""Anything can lead you to a universal,"" she said, from mundane chores to confronting ponderous truths about life and death.</p> <p>Weber, 68, grew up in various places, thanks to her father's career teaching at universities like Yale and several others.</p> <p>""I've always written poetry,"" composing her first poem ""when I was maybe 8 years old. It was terrible poetry,"" she confesses with a laugh.</p> <p>An English major in college, she moved to Maine in 1968 and started a family. She taught for years in Orrington, near Brewer, and in the last five years of her career taught on Indian Island for the Penobscot Indian Nation reservation. There was no time for poetry.</p> <p>""I was raising three sons and teaching, and when you teach, you kind of give it all away,"" she said, though she did some writing on summer breaks.</p> <p>After retiring, her sons encouraged her to write, and to publish that work.</p> <p>""This was my springboard,"" she said.</p> <p>Her son Tom had moved to the island for work, then son Matt followed. Matt now fishes (his boat ""Seldom Seen"" appears in one of the poems) and operates Monhegan Brewery. Weber visited in summers.</p> <p>""I fell in love with it,"" she remembers.</p> <p>Like Robert Frost, a New England poet whose place-based poems often used the landscape and local ways to lead the reader toward deeper truths, Weber's poems are tied to that rocky island. And like Frost's poems, her work is clear.</p> <p>""It doesn't have to be inaccessible to be profound,"" she said. The poems in <em>Cutting the Grass with Scissors</em> indeed are accessible, yet, with surprising efficiency, take the reader to a place where contemplation is demanded.</p> <p>Consider ""Recluse"": </p> <p>            Sooner or later</p> <p>            You have to walk down the road</p> <p>            For milk or the fulfillment</p> <p>            of some obligation.</p> <p> </p> <p>            You will have</p> <p>            a minimum of three conversations.</p> <p>            At least one will be unsettling</p> <p>            in either a vague</p> <p> </p> <p>            or concrete way.</p> <p>            You will hear opposite interpretations</p> <p>            of the same incident.</p> <p>            When you return home,</p> <p> </p> <p>            the day will be different.</p> <p>            Your meditations will have left</p> <p>            the flimsy wavering</p> <p>            of poplar leaves in wind,</p> <p> </p> <p>            or turned them from a shimmer</p> <p>            in the light to metaphor.</p> <p>            It will take an hour gazing at the ocean</p> <p>            to restore peace.</p> <p> </p> <p>""We do it to make connections,"" Weber said of the urge to write poems. Connections between encounters and emotions, as in the above poem, or connections between the natural and human worlds, or, as in ""Retaining Wall,"" connections between art and work:</p> <p>            Here on the hillside,</p> <p>            I'm writing poetry. Below me,</p> <p>            My neighbor has rented a jackhammer</p> <p>            and is building a retaining wall.</p> <p> </p> <p>            First, he brought in a bulldozer</p> <p>            to clear away the loam, loose rubble</p> <p>            of jumbled rocks beneath, and now</p> <p>            he's vibrating deep into bedrock.</p> <p> </p> <p>            It's hard work, the digging down,</p> <p>            the setting of the rebar into solid ledge,</p> <p>            the finishing with comely stones,</p> <p>            harmoniously placed.</p> <p> </p> <p>            But he keeps at it.</p> <p>            I do, too. The same work, really,</p> <p>            constructing against the hill's</p> <p>            inevitable slide</p> <p>Poems are born, she said, ""When something amazes me. When I start, I'm not really sure where I'm going,"" she said of the writing process. That was the case with ""Tuna Nights,"" one of her favorites.</p> <p>""I was writing it for my son Matt, who adores tuna fishing, and suddenly it went somewhere else,"" becoming a wild fantasy where tuna grow feet, climb into boats while fishermen sleep ""in their squid suits of fluorescent pink and orange/dreaming their shocking dreams/of harpoons and Oriental markets…""</p> <p>""Wheel Over That Piano"" likens the unbidden return of past losses to Casablanca's Ingrid Bergman walking into a nightclub, ""and I'm drawn inexorably to sit down at the table/pay for the drinks.""</p> <p>""You have to be willing to go to the dark places,"" Weber said. ""And that's not easy.""</p> <p>As is the case with any good writing, the work isn't evident in the results—the poems read as if they were penned in a moment's reflection.</p> <p><em>Cutting the Grass with Scissors</em> can be purchased on Monhegan at Winter Works or by mailing $14.95 to Weber at P.O.

"<p><em>Monhegan Come Again</em> by Richard C. Moore, with foreword by Earle G. Shettleworth, Jr.</p> <p>Pawtuckaway Publishers, 2014. 96 pp. Softbound, $29.95</p> <p><em>Island Voices II, Poetry of Monhegan</em> Kennebunk: Stone Island Press, 2014. 52 pp. Softbound, $14.95 </p> <p>This year, the quadricentennial of Captain John Smith's first visit to Monhegan is being marked and memorialized in many ways. The 400th anniversary has been an occasion for special exhibitions and entertainments on the island, including ""The Famous and the Forgotten: Revisiting Monhegan’s Celebrated 1914 Art Exhibition,"" the Monhegan Museum’s contribution to the festivities.</p> <p>The 400th also has been the inspiration for several publications. In Richard Moore's remarkable <em>Monhegan Come Again</em>, the New Hampshire photographer has turned to the wonders of digital photography to create composite photos that create a kind of visual inter-time zone. Working from antique postcards and photographs of the island, Moore took a CSI approach, a kind of visual forensics, lining up the past and the present.</p> <p>With its unchanging quality, Monhegan seems the perfect subject for Moore's ""twice-seen"" aesthetic. Other than clothing, a few satellite dishes and maybe a touch of vinyl on some of the houses, this island maintains a Brigadoon quality. Thus, many of Moore's composites appear almost seamless in their intermingling of place and people: you have to look twice to see where vintage ends and modern starts.</p> <p>Moore can be witty in his juxtapositions. The famous photo of the island's cornet band (including the painter George Bellows on snare drum) is joined with a hand-made sign for ultimate Frisbee. Likewise, women in full-length skirts and men in straw boaters wend their way to the steamboat through a corridor of pick-up trucks.</p> <p>The book concludes with a bit of ekphrasis: Iris Miller's poem about one of Moore's composite photos. In cataloguing the details in the image, Miller, who is the main figure in the photo, helps us understand the cross-historical nature of these composites—hints of a library not yet built, oxen moving, as it were, across time zones.  </p> <p>This verse makes for a nice segue to <em>Island Voices II</em>, where Miller is one of 12 featured poets, all women, who have been meeting weekly on Monhegan for the past 20 summers to respond to and encourage each other's writings. Each poet is represented by one to four poems.</p> <p>Leading off is one of the best-known poets of the island, Jan Bailey, who sets the stage for a range of island evocations. Her portraits of a seal pup and an ocean sunfish are stunning. Her lyric ""Song"" finds an echo in Kate Cheney Chappell's ""What Is Singing in Us,"" which conjures the ""island hymn sing night"" where the gathered join in :Amazing Grace.""</p> <p>Monhegan materializes in these poems, from Judith Grey's ""Fern Glen"" (where the fiddleheads are ""grouped as if for cocktails"") to Marilyn Ringer's clothesline (where ""the laundry snaps its happy song""). In addition to four poems, watercolorist Joanne Scott contributes a painting of a tree hung with lobster buoys for the cover—a fitting introduction to a working island where the elements are ever present and the ""power of water,"" as Jan Kornbluth puts it, holds the fishermen in thrall.    </p> <p>Monhegan Come Again<em> and </em>Island Voices II<em> are available on Monhegan and at Archipelago in Rockland.

"<p><em>Ian Watkins is an Island Fellow, a participant in a two-year service program operated by AmeriCorps and the Island Institute, doing community development work on islands and remote coastal communities. Watkins works on Deer Isle and the Downeast coast with high school students.</em></p> <p>Living on an island, it can be very easy to fall into your routine and daily habits, seemingly unaware of what's going on outside your immediate island environment.</p> <p>Compared to other places I've lived, it seems to be a custom I've most heavily adopted on Deer Isle.</p> <p>Having the Internet, the world is still theoretically at my fingertips, but observation can be taxing, and being an Island Fellow has refocused my attention to my more daily interactions and routines. Everything else can sometimes seem to be a world away.</p> <p>One of my routines is volunteering a few hours a week at the island-mentoring center, which is right around the corner from my house. My shifts are during the center's open hours, meaning some days there are visitors and others not. On days with visitors, a typical activity might include cooking some food, playing cards or just people visiting and having dinner.</p> <p>For example, during my first shift, I invited a number of students from the high school and we made a big pot of gumbo. During slower shifts, tasks include cleaning, shoveling the front walk, or any number of general upkeep duties to keep the place looking shipshape. With those volunteer duties finished, I might read a book or have some time to play my guitar or fiddle. It was this latter activity that caught the attention of a photographer from the <em>Boston Globe</em> who just happened to be walking though the crossroads village of Sunset, where the mentoring center is located.</p> <p>When the knock on the door came, I was sitting at the front table that greets guests who enter the center and playing my fiddle. When I opened the door to the frigid evening, a stranger with a much-too-thin coat greeted me. I quickly took note of his car parked across the street—one that I didn't recognize. Clearly, he wasn't a local.</p> <p>We exchanged greetings and I noticed that aside from his unseasonable coat, he was also carrying a camera.</p> <p>""I saw you playing the fiddle from outside,"" he said. I told him that he could take a few shots of me playing if he'd like, and before shutting the door to go inside he asked, ""Oh, what do you do?"" I did my best to answer, saying all the important key words to a reporter who would have no idea what ""Island Fellow"" means. ""A world away,"" I thought to myself as I went back inside to keep playing long enough for a few pictures.</p> <p>Being cold, it wasn't long before he gave me an affirmative thumbs up from outside the window and briskly jogged back to his car. I continued to play my fiddle a few more minutes before shutting off the lights, locking the door to the mentor center for the night and promptly returning to my standard routine, forgetting all about the encounter. Several weeks had past before one day my recognizable posture and profile appeared playing a fiddle in a photo essay on Deer Isle and Isle au Haut published by the <em>Boston Globe</em>; a small portion of my daily routine captured and presented a world away.</p> <p>The photo essay may be viewed here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1zFwHHz"">http://bit.ly/1zFwHHz</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","Boston Globe photographer captures Island Fellow at work, play","February 2, 2015",by  Ian Watkins,Small-world routine documented for bigger world

Always fascinated by the natural world, the coastal flora and fauna captured her attention. She pitched a weekly column on her island explorations to the newspaper's editor, and her journalistic journey began. </p> <p>The attraction in these short articles is the abundance of information, topic by littoral topic. Each one unwraps interesting details on everything from tree sap to spiderwebs, cormorants, caterpillars and crickets, to red tide, voles, seals and the mechanics of the solstice. And there are points to catch the eye of just about anyone with an inkling for nature, from casual kitchen window observer, to amateur naturalist, to even some specialists.</p> <p>Curious facts abound: Some species of periwinkles can breathe air; shrews are poisonous; maple taps catch sap as it flows down the tree, not up. It's surprising to learn that the winter-summer cycles of puffins – practically an icon of Maine's Down East coast – have only recently been studied in any detail. Researchers were surprised to discover one bird, tagged with a tracking device at Seal Island, traveled north to the Labrador Sea and as far south as the mid-Atlantic. Details of puffin feeding habits and capabilities also are not well-known to scientists:</p> <p>“Scientists believe that puffins at sea locate areas where prey is abundant by looking for concentrations of phytoplankton, the single-celled plants that are the basis of the ocean food web. Where there is phytoplankton, there is zooplankton, the tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton. Where there is zooplankton there are small fish feeding and that makes good hunting for puffins.”</p> <p>Grouped within the headings of American nature writing's ur convention – Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter – these reports from Isle au Haut offer compact rehearsals of the fascinating scientific facts behind the things Mainers see in their backyards and beaches every day, and have always wondered about.</p> <p>The book is available online and by writing to Penobscot Books, P.O.

"<p>Gathering places in rural communities have always fascinated me. I can recall a few when I was growing up in Virginia, one of which was the general store where my great uncle Rolie would gather regularly with his pals over coffee, and more than likely, exaggerated conversation.</p> <p>I liked the general store not for the coffee, but for the ice cream that was stored in old-fashioned slide top coolers, seeming to stretch the entire length of the building. Having the arm length that I lacked, my uncle Rolie would often snag ice cream bars for me that were out of my reach.</p> <p>While the ice cream of my childhood surely wasn't a requirement, I was curious when I moved here to the Deer Isle-Stonington area whether the island had any similar gathering places. I was pleased to learn that several places did exist, and being a musician, that I was invited to the gathering, which encouraged bringing instruments.</p> <p>I arrived carrying my fiddle, entering the front doorway to a crowded room of musicians and on-lookers. Sitting on Main Street in downtown Stonington, the gathering spot doubled as a fisherman's shop. It was this particular fisherman who greeted me from across the room as I entered the tightly occupied space.</p> <p>""Where have you been?"" he asked through the noise of tuning instruments and Sunday morning conversation. ""Well, there he is,"" someone else confirmed.</p> <p>Scouting the room for an empty space, I weaved my way through the crowd, greeting the regulars until I found enough room to get out my fiddle and join in the music. There were several guitars, a bass, mandolin, banjo and an accordion. I was not only a new face, but also the only fiddler present.</p> <p>Shortly after I had my fiddle tuned, someone launched into the Jimmie Rodgers classic, ""Blue Yodel No. 1 (T For Texas)"", the vocals adding in a signature Downeast accent. Playing in the key of D, this was a perfect first tune, and I promptly jumped in to take a lead after the second verse. After the song came to a close, the crowd of musicians and on-lookers gave me nods and smiles of approval, making me feel very welcome at this their standard Sunday morning gathering.</p> <p>While growing up, I was used to playing music being very much a standard at such gatherings. It's been something I've missed quite a bit on the island, so naturally I was thrilled to be invited and welcomed by this gregarious group of musicians and watermen. Their wit and spirit reminded me of the musical enthusiasm I so often identify with the South, and I dare say it reminded me of home.</p> <p><em>Ian Watkins is an Island Fellow through AmeriCorps and the Island Institute, working at Deer Isle-Stonington High School. </em></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",,"December 1, 2014",by  Ian Watkins,Downeast jam: Making music a way to bond in new community

"<p>SWAN'S ISLAND — Whether it's a wedding, reunion or holiday celebration, photographers often struggle to get all the key family members in their shots. Imagine how hard it was for Miranda Battiste to capture the family that is the island's year-round population.</p> <p>By most measures, Batiste succeeded. Not only are the images—as evidenced by those reproduced here—full of life, with ample servings of personality and spontaneity, but she also was able to document 100-plus households of the island's 140.</p> <p>It was hard work, though.</p> <p>After sending letters to everyone in town last April asking to photograph them, she agreed to meet her subjects at the setting of their choice—on the beach, at the lighthouse, in their homes, yards or on their boats.</p> <p>""I went to wherever they wanted to have their photo taken,"" she said.</p> <p>And she shot and shot and shot. Some sessions yielded 100 or more photos. For one family, she came home with 190 images. In all, she collected over 3,000 images.</p> <p>""Editing,"" the process of reviewing the digital images and cropping and tweaking the best ones, ""has been a complete nightmare,"" she confessed.</p> <p>But, clearly, it was a labor of love.</p> <p>""It started off as trying to get a record of all the people who live on the island year-round,"" Batiste said. ""It's a part of history.""</p> <p>The high participation rate relates to island life, she said.</p> <p>""There's no place to hide,"" she said. ""We just kept badgering people. People would say, 'Oh my God, here she is with her camera.'""</p> <p>Rather than consistently pose people for formal portraits, Batiste opted to let the subjects set the tone. Some are portraits, some are candids, with ""People talking, husbands kissing wives… lovely things.
